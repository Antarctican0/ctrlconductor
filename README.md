# Run8 Control Conductor

A modular GUI application that maps joystick/gamepad inputs to Run8 train simulator functions via UDP communication.

## Features

- **Multi-device Support**: Connect and use multiple controllers simultaneously
- **Flexible Input Mapping**: Map buttons, axes, and hat switches to Run8 functions
- **Real-time Processing**: Low-latency input processing for responsive control
- **Modular Architecture**: Clean, maintainable code structure
- **User-friendly Interface**: Intuitive GUI with tabbed organization
- **Persistent Settings**: Save and load your controller configurations
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Built-in debugging and error reporting

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **No devices detected**: 
   - Ensure controllers are connected and recognized by Windows
   - Click "Refresh Devices" after connecting new devices

2. **Input not responsive**:
   - Check if device is enabled (checkbox checked)
   - Verify the mapping is correct
   - Try re-mapping the input

3. **Connection issues**:
   - Verify Run8 is running and listening on the specified port
   - Check firewall settings
   - Ensure IP address and port are correct

### Debug Information
