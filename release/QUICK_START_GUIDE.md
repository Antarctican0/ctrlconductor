### Step 3: Map Your Controls
1. **Navigate tabs**: Use the tabs at the top (Main Controls, Lights & Wipers, DPU, Misc)
2. **Map functions**: Click "Map Input" next to any function you want to control
3. **Move/press control**: Within 5 seconds, move/press the desired control on your joystick

## üí° Tips
- **Save Your Setup**: Always click "Save Mappings" when you're happy with your controller setup
- **Load Previous Setup**: Click "Load Mappings" to restore previously saved settings
- **Multiple Controllers**: You can enable and use multiple controllers at the same time
- **Reverse Controls**: For throttle/brake levers, use the "Reverse" checkbox if they feel backwards

## üîß Troubleshooting

- **No response in Run8**: Check that Run8 is running and the IP/port settings are correct (usually 127.0.0.1:18888)
